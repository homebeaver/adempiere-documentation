# Becoming a Developer

A Developer in the ADempiere bazaar is a person who contributes code, documentation or other work that is of value to the community. Anyone can become a Developer by making contributions. It is one of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of being involved in an open source community project.

## Becoming a Developer

The ADempiere Project uses [GitHub](https://github.com/adempiere) for its repository. To contribute as a developer, you will need to have a GitHub account and you should fork the [ADempiere](https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere) project or one of the other sub-projects depending on your interests. All your work will be done in your own fork and contributions can be added to the project through GitHub's pull-request process.

You must respect the [Software Development Procedure.](software-development-procedure.md) You can create your own repository for contributions and develop freely within that directory. In the main code repository, you will need permission before you can create a branch or start development on a new feature.

After you have proven yourself as a developer, you can ask to join the community as a citizen. Eventually, you can be given the status of Committer with access and responsibility for the main code repository.
