# Date + Time Field

## Date + Time ![Image:Icon\_Calendar24.png](../../../.gitbook/assets/calendar24.gif)

Date with time control is similar to the [Date](date-field.md) control but includes the time component with the full timestamp format of yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss. The text field can't be edited directly so you have to click the button to open the [Calendar Tool](../dialogs-and-forms/calendar-tool.md) to enter the values.

See [Date Field](date-field.md) for more information.
