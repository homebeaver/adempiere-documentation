# Revenue Recognition

At the time of writing, automated revenue recognition process had not been implemented.

Revenue recognition could be achieved manually by setting the product's Product Revenue account to a deferred revenue account and recognizing the revenue via a general journal entry.

The Revenue Recognition window could be used to define the rules related to the recognition and link these to a product for information purposes.
