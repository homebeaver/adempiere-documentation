# Product Classifications, Classes and Groups

There are several windows that provide means to classify the products in trees of hierarchy to ease reporting:

* Product Classification
* Product Class
* Product Group

Each of these is similar, providing a name and a link to a parent.  Like the Product Category, these could be used to report on product results. Their use is optional.

By creating entries in these windows, you can select the Group, Class and Classification in the Product window from a drop down list.

{% hint style="info" %}
The system administrator will have to create custom reports using parent Product Group, Class or Classifications.  The default reports do not provide summaries by parent.
{% endhint %}

In addition, there are three text fields in the Product window that allow further identification for reporting:

* Group 1
* Group 2
* Classification

These fields are uncontrolled and could hold any text value.
