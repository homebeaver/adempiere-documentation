# Defining the Product

With the setup work complete, the products can be created easily using the Product Window.  There are several mandatory elements to the product definition:

* **Product** **Name**
* **Product Category**
* **Tax Category**
* **Unit of Measure**
* **Product Type**

These are the minimum required to define the product.  Apart form the mandatory fields, there is a large number of other fields helpful in defining the products.  The next sections will go into more detail on how to configure these fields.  But first, its important to look at the various [Product Types](product-types.md) possible so some of the terms will make sense.
