# Product Setup

## Product Setup

Product setup involves several steps:

1. Defining the [Warehouses and Locators](warehouse-and-locators.md) that will be used to store products;
2. Defining the [Units of Measure](units-of-measure.md) that the products will use;
3. Create [Asset Groups](asset-groups.md) to define the accounting for the asset products
4. Creating [Product Categories](product-categories.md) which will define the accounts to use to record the costs and revenue from the product. You can also create [Product Classifications, Classes and Groups](product-classifications-classes-and-groups.md) to assist in summarizing reports;
5. Create [Product Attributes, Sets and Instances](product-attributes-sets-and-instances/)
6. Follow the [Tax Setup](../../accounting-and-performance-analysis/tax-setup.md) process to define the [Tax Categories](../../accounting-and-performance-analysis/tax-setup.md#tax-category) that will be applied when the product is purchase or sold;
7. Setting the [Revenue Recognition](../../revenue-recognition.md) rules for the product; and finally
8. Defining the product itself.
