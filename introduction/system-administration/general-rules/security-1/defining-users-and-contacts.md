# Defining Users and Contacts

Users are an important aspect of the ADempiere Application.  The Application tracks every action taken by users  and ensures the security of the data and process by ensuring that users only see what they are allowed to see and can only change what they are allowed to change.

There are two types of Users of the ADempiere Application: Users who represent customers or vendors and who may have access to the web store; and Users who access the Client and Application data. The first type is also considered a Contact of a Business Partner.

Contacts can also be added and managed through the **Contacts** tab of the **Business Partner** window found in the **Partner Relations &gt; Business Partner Rules** menu.
{% endhint %}

 For security, every User who is to have access to the Application must be assigned at least one Role in the Client.
